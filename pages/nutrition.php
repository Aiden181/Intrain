                <h2>Health Is About More Than Your Weight</h2>
                <p>Most people focus too much on weight gain or loss. The truth is that health goes way beyond that. Many obese people are metabolically healthy, while many normal-weight people have the same metabolic problems associated with obesity. Focusing just on body weight is counterproductive. It’s possible to improve health without losing weight — and vice versa.

                <h2>Calories Count - But You Don’t Necessarily Need To Count Them</h2>
                <p>Calories are important. Obesity is a matter of excess stored energy, or calories, accumulating in the form of body fat. However, this doesn’t mean you need to monitor everything that enters your body and track or count calories. Though calorie counting works for a lot of people, you can do many things to lose weight — without ever having to count a single calorie.

                    <h2>Neither Fat Nor Carbs Make You Fat</h2>
                    <p>Fat has often been blamed for obesity, as it has more calories per gram than protein and carbs. Yet, people who eat a diet high in fat — but low in carbs — end up eating fewer calories than people on low-fat, high-carb diets. This has conversely led many people to blame carbs for obesity — which is incorrect as well. Plenty of populations throughout history have eaten high-carb diets but remained healthy. As with almost everything in nutrition science, the issue depends on the context. Both fat and carbs can be fattening — it all depends on the rest of your diet and your overall lifestyle.
